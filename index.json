All content ahead were adapted \u0026amp; compiled from multiple sources on the Internet. Please excercise caution if you choose to take any of the content seriously, since this is only an opiniated viewpoint of a noob coder\nOkay that was a joke xD.. But again my views are based on the limited experience I have with git, github and version control. So do your own googling \u0026amp; research before applying any of the practices mentioned in here. If used irresponsibly git could potentially mess up your entire codebase. That said we\u0026rsquo;ll now move on to the actual objective: learn how to git it responsibly.\nGit, Set, Go! Git is an integral part of a developer‚Äôs workflow. No matter what organization or development team you go to, Git is ever-present in some form.\n$ man git \u0026gt; NAME: git - the stupid content tracker As the man page for git reads, it is a content tracker and it is pretty stupid, unless you train it and guide it to make it smart. How? Read on.\n10 ways to make Git (and Github :D) smart\n1. Don‚Äôt git push straight to master Regardless if you use Gitflow or any other git branching model, it is always a good idea to turn on git branch protection to prevent direct commits and ensure your main branch code is deployable at all times. All commits should be pushed to master through pull requests.\n2. Don‚Äôt commit code as an unrecognized author Sometimes you commit code using the wrong email address, and as a result GitHub shows that your commit has an unrecognized author. Having commits with unrecognized authors makes it more difficult to track who wrote which part of the code.\nEnsure your Git client is configured with the correct email address and linked to your GitHub user. Check your pull requests during code reviews for unrecognized commits.\n3. Require commit signing Commit signing is a process of cryptographically signing the code merge for verification and traceability. This is important for code audit trails because it is not hard to pretend to be someone else in a commit. All it takes is a malicious user to change their username and email address in git config and push an exploitive code merge.\nYou can set up your Git to sign commits through GPG and configure your commits with a private key in your git config. Once this is done, you can add your GPG key to Github. Now when commits are made, a ‚Äòverified‚Äô badge shows up next to the commit.\n4. Create a meaningful git ignore file A .gitignore file is a must in each repository to ignore predefined files and directories. It will help you to prevent secret keys, dependencies and many other possible discrepancies in your code. You can choose a relevant template from gitignore.io to get started quickly.\n5. Enforce 2-factor authentication While 2FA can not be considered an end-to-end method of protecting from data breaches, two-factor authentication (2FA) is now the industry standard for account security. It should also be your organization‚Äôs standard security requirement to prevent code leakages through insecure accounts.\n2FA adds an extra layer of security when logging into GitHub and can be enforced at the organizational level through your organization‚Äôs settings. To do this, navigate to your organization list, select ‚ÄòOrganization security‚Äô and under ‚ÄòAuthentication‚Äô select ‚ÄòRequire two-factor authentication for everyone‚Äô.\nWhen you click ‚ÄòSave‚Äô, you may be prompted with details concerning individuals who do not have 2FA activated. They will be removed from the organization and can only be added back in once 2FA has been implemented on their account. You can view members who have been removed in your organization‚Äôs audit logs.\n6. Don‚Äôt commit local config files into source control I strongly recommend against committing your local config files to git. Usually, those are private configuration files we don‚Äôt want to push to remote because they are may hold secrets, personal preferences, history or general information that should stay only in your local environment.\n7. Use a branch naming convention Adopting a consistent branch naming convention is essential to keeping our repository organized as our team grows in size. An efficient naming convention will allow our to keep merge conflicts at a minimum while ensuring your developers are as productive as possible.\nWhile there are many branch naming conventions, one of the most popular ones is known as git flow.\n8. Archive dead repositories Over time, for various reasons, we find ourselves with unmaintained repositories. Sometimes developers create repos for an ad hoc use case, a POC, or some other reason. Sometimes they inherit repos with old and irrelevant code.\nIn any of these cases, the repos were left intact. No one is doing any development work in those repos anymore, so you want to clean them up and avoid the risk of other people using them. The best practice is to archive them, i.e. make them ‚Äúread-only‚Äù to everyone.\n9. Define code owners for faster code reviews When you‚Äôre dealing with dozens, hundreds, or more repositories and engineers, it‚Äôs nearly impossible to know who owns which parts of the codebase and need to review your changes.\nEven in smaller teams you‚Äôd still have code owners ‚Äì for example, front-end code changes should be reviewed by the Front-End Engineer.\nUse Code Owners feature to define which teams and people are automatically selected as reviewers for the repository.\n10. Leverage task lists Tasks lists provide a way for you to track TODOs directly within comments, issues, and even markdown files within your repository.\nThey provide an excellent way to capture a high-level overview of a task or issue, as well as keep others up-to-date on its state. You should definitely try out this feature!\nBONUS: Try GitLens This is not promotion\nI just started using this extension on VS-Code a few weeks back and found it super useful - specifically to blame people :). A blame in git-jargon means the dev who last modified a particular line in a file to ruin the whole project. In short git blame helps you blame for real.\nGitLens just makes it easier to blame your fellow devs. No more commands or terminal screens, just open your file to see the commit and author who last modified any line. Isn\u0026rsquo;t that (super)cool?\nDid you git it? We devs spend a lot of time working with Git and GitHub, so investing in improving your Git/GitHub practices makes a lot of sense. Implementing the practices mentioned in this guide could (possibly?) help you improve your developer productivity and reduce security risks.\n","permalink":"https://arv.codes/blog/git-best-practices/","summary":"10 best git practices you are not following yet (opiniated!)","title":"I don't git it?"},{"content":"A bit of context Well if you\u0026rsquo;re not sure what this page is about then I\u0026rsquo;ll give you some context: This is a brief about how I managed why I decided to code Baymax - A Discord bot which is designed to moderate TinkerHub NSSCE\u0026rsquo;s official Discord server. And apparently this is my first (real) blog post üêå, so do read through and comment your genuine thoughts.\nSo here\u0026rsquo;s how it started ¬Ø\\_(„ÉÑ)_/¬Ø Managing a community is a form of art. An art that can get frustrating over time. As your community grows so does it\u0026rsquo;s core values \u0026amp; directions start fading away. Each new member brings in new ideas \u0026amp; perspectives to the table - all of which builds upon the existing foundation of the community. Eventually the foundation gets abandoned - the structure above seems to be self sustaining \u0026amp; capable of withstanding any and all external impacts. But applying rational thought, anyone can observe that the maintainence of the foundation is as much as important as building the structure above - only then can the building/community stand the test of time.\nOkay! Maybe all that wisdom talk went over your head. Don\u0026rsquo;t worry that\u0026rsquo;s fine, the analogy wasn\u0026rsquo;t thought out well. Anyway what I\u0026rsquo;m trying to say is that - If you\u0026rsquo;re bound to commit to any repetitive actions in order to maintain a healthy community while preserving it\u0026rsquo;s original values, they get tedious and exhausting over time (SPOILER: unless you\u0026rsquo;re a bot). I\u0026rsquo;ve personally dealt with this problem and yeah I did come up with a workaround. Wonder how? I automated all the actions ^_~\nThe actual problem Our discord server initially started out as a small, quiet and modest place where anyone interested in our community can join, hang out and connect with each other. Since it was still in it\u0026rsquo;s nascent phase and had only a handful of members it was easy to keep track and moderate all of them with a small mod team. But as the server started to grow, the need for a more efficient moderation and member verification system arose. Why? You might ask. I heard you.. its because if you\u0026rsquo;ve been using discord for atleast a while now, you might have realized - only a minority of users present their real identities/names. This is not something we can endorse in a real community. Communities are built over mutual trust and respect for each other and this requires everyone to present their real identies as a first step. This holds true regardless of the platform used by the community.\nAround the same time this problem arose, our campus community chapter had an execom shift and I joined the team as the Tech Lead. Having worked in the bot development team at ¬µLearn - I had some experience with discord.py. I initially set out to build something similar to the onboarding process in the ¬µLearn\u0026rsquo;s discord server handled by Aaronchettan. In fact TBH I did end up using a lot of inspiration from it\u0026rsquo;s codebase (CTRL^C + CTRL^V). But yet today Baymax has evolved into something completely unique except for the core idea - a bot to help manage a community.\nThe workaround If you\u0026rsquo;ve watched Big Hero 6 you\u0026rsquo;re probably famliar with Baymax - the huggable robot built to help a lot of people. Being a fan of the movie and the robot in specfic I tried to build one myself - a bot designed with the sole purpose of helping and guiding people. Well maybe not a physical version but a discord version. I just completed it a few days back and now its up and running. Though originally I only planned for it to automate the onboarding process, as I started developing it, I thought why stop there. So I just kept adding more features. Here\u0026rsquo;s an overview what Baymax can do right now:-\nIt automatically assigns roles and a nickname from the response received in an airtable form It can have natural conversations with members and answer questions about itself, TinkerHub etc (uses DialogFlow for NLP) It can make you laugh with jokes or lighten you up with inspiring quotes It can find the latest hot news in tech and deliver them directly to the server (sources: HackerNews \u0026amp; Dev.to) There certainly is a lot more he can do, if you\u0026rsquo;re curious enough then you should find out for yourself by joining our server here üëâ https://discord.gg/2bBPbdRud6 (I swear this is not promotion!!).\nWe even had bigger plans for Baymax, as you might have known hacktoberfest'22 was just around the corner. So we thought, why not make Baymax open source. With contributions from new comers/existing open source devs, the bot would keep getting better and maybe even evolve into something more. Here\u0026rsquo;s the repo link: https://github.com/Tinkerhub-NSSCE/baymax. There\u0026rsquo;s still 2 days left to win the t-shirt so why not give it try. Sadly we haven\u0026rsquo;t recieved any major PRs so far, but again you can always contribute to Baymax even after Hacktoberfest, we can get you a cooler t-shirt (maybe..)\nThis is certainly not a technical blog and so I wouldn\u0026rsquo;t go deep into how Baymax was built. This is just an overview of why baymax exists and why it was built, hope you got an idea of the same. I could not think of a better place to share my thoughts. Perhaps I\u0026rsquo;ll write another blog on how I coded the bot sometime in the future (We\u0026rsquo;ll see). However if you\u0026rsquo;re still prying at the build of the bot, I\u0026rsquo;ve listed out the major libraries/tools I\u0026rsquo;ve used to create Baymax along with the project source in the next section\nWhat\u0026rsquo;s under the hood? discordpy dialogflow google-cloud-dialogflow pyairtable pillow project-source Some exclusive BTS photos from the dev phase That\u0026rsquo;s all for now.
